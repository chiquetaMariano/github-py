# Utilities

some useful scripts and tools I developed

## Tools

* **github-downloader (v1.0)**: a simple downloader for github repositories. Useful when you don't want to download every file in a repo. It has a simple CLI.
It needs some refactoring but is up and running so you can use it, anyways.
