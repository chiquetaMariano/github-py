# github-py (v1.0)

A simple CLI in python to download github repositories. Useful if you don't want a more custom download (can select files, folders and subfolders instead of complete repos). The code needs some refactoring but is up and running so you can use it anyways.

**Update: broken. The code must be adapted to the new github API version.**
